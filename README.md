# Meme Me
This is the second portfolio app from Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree. With this app, the user can create multiple memes
using their photos from the media library or take one from their camera directly. MemeMe allows the user to select a
picture, and add text at the top and bottom to create their own a meme then save the new photo to their phone.
Saved Memes will appear in a tab view using two views: a table view and a collection view.
